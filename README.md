# Node.js Express + Create React App => SSR/CSR project

A simple React server-side rendering sample project + CSR for functional JS layer.
The idea is to have create-react-app that works as normal CSR SPA app
+
Node.js Express server on the back of it to parse all of functional output into static HTML.

Goal of this sample app is to use a simple ready made mechanism without any additional frameworks, setups, ssg's and so on..essentially to show how magic works under the hood üßô‚Äç
